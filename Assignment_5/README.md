# Assignment_5

## Weekly Project

### Requirements
Create a new project using the code from the last assignment.

Currently emotions change over 1 second and the face is held for 1 second.

Convert one primitive shape to a polygon. (A poly mouth could be good here.)

Starting at each change, play a sound that you either created or downloaded (with attribution in your .md file). Make sure each sound is < 2 seconds.

Since this project uses sound, you will have to upload a youtube file for your README.md .
